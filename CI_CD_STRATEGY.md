# CI/CD Strategy

This document outlines the CI/CD architecture, Docker strategy, and security measures implemented in this project.

## CI/CD Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to provide fast feedback and ensure code quality. It follows a Lint -> Test -> Build -> Scan -> Push workflow.

* **Linting:** The `lint` job runs `pre-commit` to check for code style, formatting, and other quality issues. This ensures that all code merged into the main branches is clean and consistent.
* **Testing:** The `test` job runs the test suite using `pytest` against a matrix of Python versions (3.10, 3.11, and 3.12). This ensures that the code is compatible with all supported Python versions.

## Docker Strategy

The Docker strategy is designed to create a secure, efficient, and reproducible Docker image.

* **Multi-Stage Build:** The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build to create a lean production image. The first stage installs the build dependencies and builds the application. The second stage copies the application code and installs the production dependencies.
* **Non-Root User:** The production image runs as a non-root user to reduce the attack surface.
* **Caching:** The `docker.yml` workflow uses Docker layer caching to speed up the build process.

## Security Measures

Security is a top priority in this project. The following security measures are in place:

* **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** The CI/CD workflows are configured with the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.
* **SHA Pinning:** All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to their full commit SHA to prevent supply chain attacks.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** The `docker.yml` workflow uses Trivy to scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities. The build will fail if any critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are found.
