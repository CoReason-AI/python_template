# Python Packaging Audit Report

This document outlines the results of an audit of the repository against modern Python packaging standards (PEP 517, PEP 518, PEP 621, PEP 508, and PEP 660).

## Phase 1: Assessment Checklist (Audit)

### 1. Central Configuration and Legacy Files
- **`pyproject.toml`**: **[PASS]** A `pyproject.toml` file exists at the root, which is mandatory for modern packaging.
- **Legacy Files**: **[PASS]** `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and `requirements.txt` are not used for core metadata or dependency management. All configuration is correctly centralized in `pyproject.toml`.
- **`poetry.lock`**: **[FAIL]** A `poetry.lock` file is present. This is a legacy artifact from a previous Poetry-based setup and is inconsistent with the current `setuptools` build backend. It must be removed.
- **`MANIFEST.in`**: **[PASS]** This file is not present.

### 2. Build System (PEP 517 & PEP 518)
- **`[build-system]` Table**: **[PASS]** This table is present in `pyproject.toml`.
- **`build-backend`**: **[PASS]** A modern, PEP 517-compliant backend, `setuptools.build_meta`, is specified.
- **`requires`**: **[PASS]** The build dependencies are correctly listed as `["setuptools>=61.0"]`.

### 3. Project Metadata (PEP 621)
- **`[project]` Table**: **[PASS]** This table is present in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Core Metadata**: **[PASS]** All required fields (`name`, `version`, `authors`, `description`, `readme`, `requires-python`, `license`) are present and statically defined.
- **`readme`**: **[PASS]** The `readme` field correctly points to `README.md`.
- **Classifiers**: **[PASS]** Appropriate Trove classifiers are included.
- **`[project.urls]`**: **[PASS]** Relevant URLs are included.
- **Entry Points**: **[PASS]** No entry points are defined, which is appropriate for this project.

### 4. Dependencies (PEP 508)
- **`dependencies`**: **[PASS]** Runtime dependencies are correctly specified as an empty array.
- **`optional-dependencies`**: **[PASS]** Extras for development are correctly defined in `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

### 5. Project Structure and Layout
- **Layout**: **[PASS]** The project uses the recommended `src` layout (`src/my_python_project/`).
- **`__init__.py`**: **[PASS]** The `__init__.py` file is correctly used to define a regular package.

### 6. Testing Configuration
- **Location**: **[PASS]** The test suite is located in a top-level `tests/` directory.
- **Framework**: **[PASS]** `pytest` is used as the testing framework.
- **Configuration**: **[PASS]** The testing configuration is centralized in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` within `pyproject.toml`.

## Conclusion
The project is already in excellent condition and fully compliant with modern Python packaging standards. The only required action is the removal of the legacy `poetry.lock` file. No further refactoring is necessary.

## Phase 3: Conformance Verification

- **[X] Standards Compliance and Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` is the primary source of truth, the `[build-system]` is correctly configured, and all legacy configuration files have been removed.
- **[X] Structure and Discoverability**: The project utilizes the `src` layout, and the build backend is correctly configured to discover packages.
- **[X] Build Integrity**: The package builds successfully into both sdist and wheel formats using `python3 -m build`. The generated artifacts correctly include the source code, `LICENSE`, and `README` files.
- **[X] Installation and Testing**: The package can be installed in a fresh virtual environment and in editable mode. The test suite runs successfully against the installed package.
